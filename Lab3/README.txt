The learning objectives from this lab were to learn
how to create simple assembly language code and how
to work with MIPS. In this lab, we were able to learn 
about looping, the different types of system calls (such
as printing, reading, and exiting) and how to translate
code into assembly language.

I didn't actually encounter that many issues this time
around. The biggest challenge was learning how to
use the MARS IDE. Since I have a decent coding background,
I knew that this assignment wasn't going to be very 
difficult. All I really had to do was figure out how to
write conditionals and loops in a new format. The other
new thing I learned was about the syscall function. At 
first, I was confused, but it all make sense very quickly
after reading the chapters. The concept was actually kind
of similar to something from a game so after making that
comparasion I was able to understand it very easily.

I'm not really sure what about this lab would need to be
redesigned. It was already prefaced that we should have
some coding knowledge which became relevent in this
assignment. Aside from that, there wasn't really anything
wrong with the lab.

I did not collaborate with anyone on this lab.
