From this lab, I learned how to create simple circuits 
as well implement truth tables to outline the structure
for my circuits. By manipulating the different types of
gates, it's possible to control the output from the
switches. I learned that this was the key to solving
parts b and c, where the lights would only be active
on certain inputs.  In this lab, having the ability to
use multiple pages as well as using senders/receivers
made it much easier to organize. I also think the simple
design of the template page and organization of parts
made the lab much easier to navigate. However, learning
to use Multimedia Logic was a bit of a struggle since
our lab section didn't really have a tutorial. Once I
did learn it, everything fell into place pretty simply.
The only other issue I had was implementing part c with
NAND gates only, but that's due to the fact that I had
attempted it before logic conversions were presented in
lecture. If I was able to redesign the lab, I think I
would keep it pretty much the same. The lab is actually
very simple, with the main challenge being learning how
to use Multimedia Logic and discovering what you can/can't
do with the program. For me, each part had a different 
challenge corresponding to some element of learning the
program. For part a, it was learning how to use 
senders/receivers and that the circuit would work even on
multiple pages. For parts b/c, it was learning that I could
have more than one receiver of the same name. After 
understanding the rules of the program, the lab becomes much
easier.
